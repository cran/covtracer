Description: 
    Dissects a package environment or 'covr' coverage object in order to cross
    reference tested code with the lines that are evaluated, as well as linking
    those evaluated lines to the documentation that they are described within.
    Connecting these three pieces of information provides a mechanism of 
	linking tests to documented behaviors.
